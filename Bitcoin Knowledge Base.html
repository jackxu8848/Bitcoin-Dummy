Its decentralized nature, fixed supply, and growing adoption suggest it could persist long-term. However, like any asset, Bitcoin faces risks including regulatory changes, technological vulnerabilities, competition from other cryptocurrencies, or loss of trust. The possibility of collapse exists, but many believe Bitcoin's fundamentals make it increasingly resistant to complete failure as adoption grows.</p>

                                            <p>Bitcoin has a hard-coded maximum supply of 21 million coins, which is built into its protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto. This limit cannot be changed without consensus from the network. The 21 million cap creates scarcity, similar to precious metals like gold. However, when people say "Bitcoin will go to 21 million," they're usually referring to the price or adoption reaching new heights, not the supply limit. The actual number of bitcoins will approach but never exactly reach 21 million due to the mathematics of the mining reward halving, with the final bitcoin expected to be mined around the year 2140.</p>

                                            <p>The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin rests on several key principles: decentralization (no single authority controls it), scarcity (fixed supply of 21 million coins), security (cryptographic proof secured by the blockchain), transparency (all transactions are publicly verifiable), programmability (can be used as programmable money), and portability (can be sent anywhere in the world quickly). Bitcoin fundamentally represents a trustless, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates independently of governments and financial institutions, making it resistant to censorship and inflation.</p>
